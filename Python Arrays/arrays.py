#Python Arrays
'''Note: Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python Lists can be used instead.'''

'''Note: This page shows you how to use LISTS as ARRAYS, however, to work with arrays in Python you will have to import a library, like the NumPy library.
Arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable:'''


cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]

print(cars)
