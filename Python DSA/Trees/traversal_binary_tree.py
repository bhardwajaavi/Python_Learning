'''Binary Tree Traversal
Going through a Tree by visiting every node, one node at a time, is called traversal.
Since Arrays and Linked Lists are linear data structures, there is only one obvious way to traverse these: start at the first element, or node, and continue to visit the next until you have visited them all.
But since a Tree can branch out in different directions (non-linear), there are different ways of traversing Trees.
There are two main categories of Tree traversal methods:
Breadth First Search (BFS) is when the nodes on the same level are visited before going to the next level in the tree. This means that the tree is explored in a more sideways direction.
Depth First Search (DFS) is when the traversal moves down the tree all the way to the leaf nodes, exploring the tree branch by branch in a downwards direction.
There are three different types of DFS traversals:
pre-order
in-order
post-order'''
