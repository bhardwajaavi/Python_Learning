#Queue is a linear data structure that follows on first in first out (FIFO)

'''so let say student standing for the lunch in the canteen in a queue, the first student get the lunch and leave the cafeteria first.'''

'''Basic queue operations on Queue Itself
1.Enqueue- To add element in the queue.
2.Dequeue- to remove the first elelement and return the first(top) element in the queue.
3.peek- to return the first element in the queue.
4.Isempty-to check whether the queue is empty .
5.size- Find the number of element present in the queue.


Queue can be implemented by using array or the linked lists.

Queue can be implemented for job scheduling in office printers, procession booking e-ticket , and to create algorithm 
for breadth first search in graphs.

#For Python lists (and arrays), a Queue can look and behave like this:

x = [3, 8, 4, 2, 7, 4, 9, 4, 5, 5]
