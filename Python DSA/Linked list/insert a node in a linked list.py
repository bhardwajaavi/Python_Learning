'''Insert a Node in a Linked List
Inserting a node into a linked list is very similar to deleting a node, because in both cases we need to take care of the next pointers to make sure we do not break the linked list.

To insert a node in a linked list we first need to create the node, and then at the position where we insert it, we need to adjust the pointers so that the previous node points to the new node, and the new node points to the correct next node.

The simulation below shows how the links are adjusted when inserting a new node.'''
#Inserting a node in a singly linked list in Python:

class Node:
  def __init__(self, data):
    self.data = data
    self.next = None

def traverseAndPrint(head):
  currentNode = head
  while currentNode:
    print(currentNode.data, end=" -> ")
    currentNode = currentNode.next
  print("null")

def insertNodeAtPosition(head, newNode, position):
  if position == 1:
    newNode.next = head
    return newNode

  currentNode = head
  for _ in range(position - 2):
    if currentNode is None:
      break
    currentNode = currentNode.next

  newNode.next = currentNode.next
  currentNode.next = newNode
  return head

node1 = Node(7)
node2 = Node(3)
node3 = Node(2)
node4 = Node(9)

node1.next = node2
node2.next = node3
node3.next = node4

print("Original list:")
traverseAndPrint(node1)

# Insert a new node with value 97 at position 2
newNode = Node(97)
node1 = insertNodeAtPosition(node1, newNode, 2)

print("\nAfter insertion:")
traverseAndPrint(node1)
