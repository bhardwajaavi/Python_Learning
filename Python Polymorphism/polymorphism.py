'''The word "polymorphism" means "many forms", and in programming it refers to methods/functions/operators with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes.

Function Polymorphism
An example of a Python function that can be used on different objects is the len() function.

'''

#For strings len() returns the number of characters:


x = "Hello World!"

print(len(x))


#For tuples len() returns the number of items in the tuple:

mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

print(len(mytuple))

#Dictionary
'''For dictionaries len() returns the number of key/value pairs in the dictionary:'''

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}

print(len(thisdict))
