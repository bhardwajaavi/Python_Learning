#Python Numbers
"""There are three numeric types in Python:

int
float
complex
Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:"""


x = 1 #int
y = 2.8 #float
z = 1j #complex

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))


#Type Conversion
"""You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods:"""

x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

#convert from int to float:
a = float(x)

#convert from float to int:
b = int(y)

#convert from int to complex:
c = complex(x)

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))



#Random Number
"""Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:"""

import random

print(random.randrange(1, 25))
