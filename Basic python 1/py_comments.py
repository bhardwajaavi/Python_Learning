"""Creating a Comment
Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:"""

#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")


#Multiline Comments
#Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.
#To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")
